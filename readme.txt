Brand new lab! Please let us know about any problems, unclear instructions and whether some parts take too much time.

This folder is intended for Mac users, primarily using Lightweight IDE. The headers are changed accordingly. You do not need any makefile, just open the main program and run (cmd-R).

Note, however, that when shaders are NOT reloaded into the application bundle at "run". o you need to select "build" (cmd-B) to make sure they are updated.

MicroGlut is a simple replacement for the mere essentials in GLUT. You can also try FreeGLUT, but I haven't had time to do that. It has some limitations but is useable. Note that it always initializes with double buffering and Z buffer.

The code should be perfectly usable from the command-line or Xcode, but then you need a makefile or project file.
