=============  1  =============
What kind of data does the heightmap image data hold? What range is the heightmap data?
color mapped index of heights.. From black to white.



The terrain is 4x4. How many polygons does it draw?
4*4*2 = 32



=============  2  =============
Did you need to extend your camera movement code? How?
same as before, no problems.



=============  3  =============
How did you implement the cross product? Function call, inline...? Normalization?
we used VectorUtils2


Which method did you use to find the normal vector?
2



=============  4  =============
How did you figure out what surface to use?
We mapped our x and z coordinates to the indexarray and took out the quad and then checked it the x,z was in the triangle.. isch... visa kod..

How did you calculate the height from the surface?
We used the plane equation.



=============  5  =============
What kind of multitexturing function did you implement?
none

How did you handle collisions?
sphere collision, if length(center-center) < 2 then collide

How did you represent the objects to make collision detection easy/managable?
as spheres ?

How did you apply the slope on objects?
we didnt

How did you identify the water surface?
if the y pos is below 1.5 => paint blue.

How did you move the camera? What distance did you use over the terrain?
took the y coorinate of the terrain + 2

How did you decide whether to draw the model or not?
we didnt

Why don't you have to test the near plane?
nothing should be there

How did you decide which sections to draw?
we didnt
