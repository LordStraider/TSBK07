Questions:


3.1
How can you get all four blades to rotate with just one time-dependent rotation matrix?

A for-loop


How do you make the wings follow the body's movements?

Multiplicera (translera / rotera) vingarna i förhållande till kroppen



You may have to tweak some numbers to make the placement right. How can you do that without making a lot of small changes in numbers in the code followed by recompilations?


Control the value via the keyboard...??


3.2

What kind of control did you implement?

w - forward
a - left
s - backward
d - right

Look at the väderkvarn..

Can you make this kind of control in some other way than manipulating a "look-at" matrix?

Move the objects



3.3

How did you handle the camera matrix for the skybox?

We canceled the translation, but included the rotation.


How did you represent the objects? Is this a good way to manage a scene or would you do it differently for a "real" application?

Variables.. Better might be a list or similar with use of for loops


Should lighting be used for the skybox?

nope, then the skybox will be very dark.


3.4

How do you generate a vector from the surface to the eye?

vec3 eyeDirection = normalize(-surf);


Which vectors need renormalization in the fragment shader?

normalize(exNormal)
normalize(-surf)


3.5

How did you choose to combine the texture colour and the lighting colour?

only texture, no lighting


How did you choose to combine the two textures?

By adding them together
